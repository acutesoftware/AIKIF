index_code,desc,what does this mean
none,do not index this column (in this particular mapping),"dont index this column - eg for measures with floats, or encrypted data"
proj,only index strings which exist in project,get the key elements - this index is the HIGHEST lookup
core,"only index strings which already exist in aikif index (ie main things like projects, programs, events, contacts)",get any element already referred. So you need to run these indexes last. Also - this is the 2nd highest lookup
