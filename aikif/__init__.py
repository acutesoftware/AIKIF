    AIKIF
    -----------
    This is an information classification framework that maps structured or freeform data to a standard knowledge store.

    Manages a dataset of your applications, the source data, parameters, runs and results and then uses your business rules to convert and store the information in a machine usable format.

    Your AI software can link to AIKIF by setting up logging watch-points to define success / failure along with the range of input parameters. Goals and plans are defined by breaking them down to smaller tasks until the task can be run by a tool in the Toolbox.

    A tool is any python wrapped function or application and is easily extensible.
