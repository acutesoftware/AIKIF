"MindOntology:EstimationOfDistributionAlgorithms","http://wiki.opencog.org/w/MindOntology:EstimationOfDistributionAlgorithms","MindOntology:EstimationOfDistributionAlgorithms","  Estimation of Distribution Algorithms  The somewhat awkward term Estimation of Distribution Algorithm refers to an approach to optimization and program learning that combines aspects of evolutionary learning algorithms like genetic algorithms with probabilistic modeling, thus retaining the breadth and flexibility of typical evolutionary algorithms but achieving greater learning efficiency and greater ease of integration.  While EDA algorithms are quite different from Genetic Algorithms and Genetic Programming, conceptually they derive largely from this tradition, and the reader will have an easier time understanding them if he has familiarity with GA and GP as obtained e.g. from reading Goldberg's (1984) and Koza's (1991) classic texts.  The essential idea of EDAs is to replace the crossover and mutation involved in evolution with a probabilistic inference process that explicitly analyzes an evolving population, observing which patterns in the genetic material of individuals tend to correlate with fitness, and then creating new entities that display these fitness-encouraging patterns.   GA and GP have a great number of strengths, compared to other optimization approaches. In the case of GP in particular, there are really no competing methodologies possessing anywhere near a comparable breadth of applicability. But yet, anyone who has used GA/GP in practical applications has noticed the main shortcoming of the methodology: execution speed. Solving serious problems can require very large population sizes, and evolving large population sizes for an adequate number of generations can take a very long time. Because of this, it is desirable to look for ways to speed up GA/GP, or else for alternate methods that preserve the strengths of evolutionary algorithms but have faster execution speeds. A number of techniques have been tried for speeding up GA/GP, and some have proven effective, but none dramatically so. One of the better techniques is fitness inheritance. In this strategy, for a certain percentage of the population, one does not actually evaluate fitness; instead one infers the likely fitness of the population element. A crude way of doing this is to assign an element the average fitness of its parents. A more sophisticated way is to do some probabilistic inference on the fitness of the existing population. Simple versions of this technique give modest improvements; on real-world problems the speedup is often around 20%.  The speedup provided by advanced versions has not been well studied yet. The search for alternate optimization methods preserving the strengths of evolutionary algorithms but providing greater efficiency, has proved somewhat more fruitful. This is where Estimation of Distribution Algorithms come in.  An EDA uses the same basic framework as GA/GP — it iterates a population of estimated answers, and gradually converges on a population containing a lot of very good answers. But it dispenses with crossover and mutation, replacing them with probabilistic modeling — which may then be extended in various ways to incorporate various sorts of data not considered in the standard evolutionary learning approach.  In terms of natural evolution, these probabilistic modeling approaches can be thought of in terms of an eccentric sort of ""fully eugenic evolutionary process."" In this fully eugenic process, organisms do not mate with each other and produce offspring. Rather, new organisms are created by an ""evolution master."" who has:   The ability to observe the DNA of all the organisms in the population.  The ability to create a new organism from a DNA sequence, and place this organism in the population, in place of one of the existing population members.  The ability to observe the fitness of all the organisms in the population (according to the fitness criterion that interests him).  Note that the evolution master can proceed a priori theoretical understanding of the way the DNA gives rise to organisms, and no knowledge useful for building such a theoretical understanding, except for his observations of the organisms' DNA sequences and fitness. On the other hand, if he does have a priori knowledge, there's nothing stopping him from using it to improve his judgments. What will an evolution master fulfilling these criteria do?  If he is highly rational, he will tabulate statistics regarding which genes, and which combination of genes, tend to lead to high fitness. Then he will create new organisms embodying the combination of genes that tend to lead to high fitness. He will do this according to probability theory. For instance, he won't create a whole bunch of new organisms embodying exactly the maximally-fitness-inducing genes found. Rather, he'll use the fitness-inducing genes and combination found with probabilities roughly proportional to their correlations with fitness. If he has a priori knowledge, this can be incorporated as ""prior knowledge"" in his probabilistic estimates. A population ruled over by such an evolution master, it seems clear, will evolve more rapidly than one that operates by conventional evolution. The crossover operator performs a crude sort of probabilistic modeling over the evolving population.  It is a heuristic relying on the assumption that a fit organism is likely to have fit genomic subsequences, so that the combination of the genomes of two fit organisms is likely to produce a genome leading to a fit organism.  But this heuristic is just a crude approximation to what the evolution master is doing, which is actually gathering accurate statistics on the fitness of sets of genes. Now, real-world evolution doesn't have the option to use an evolution master. A natural evolving population is a ""fully distributed computing system,"" meaning that there is no centralized controller running the evolution process; rather, the evolution process must emerge from the local activities of the organisms in the population. Crossover is a wonderfully clever algorithm for distributed optimization. But in an AI system implemented on a cluster of von Neumann machines, such a widely distributed algorithm is not necessary. A centralized algorithm involving an evolution master involves less rather than more overhead, and also provides far greater mathematical efficiency. Implementing a fully rational evolution master, using probability theory to make maximally accurate analysis of gene sets, is not computationally viable. The best we could do in a OCP context would be to use full-on OCP cognition to make inferences about the fitness of genes and gene combination. In some cases this might actually be warranted — if one were optimizing a function for which fitness evaluation was extremely, extremely, extremely expensive. In most cases, however, an approximation is needed — a probabilistic reasoning algorithm that is rapid to execute and captures a reasonable amount of statistical information about the fitness of genes and gene combination in the population. Now, this is exactly what crossover and mutation are — an approximate probabilistic reasoning algorithm, rapid to execute at each individual generation (though taking a large number of generations to converge to a good answer). But it is possible to introduce approximate probabilistic inference algorithms that are more effective than the standard genetic operations, without introducing unacceptable overhead.  For example, this is what the Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (BOA; Pelikan, 2002) — the first thoroughly-tested and demonstrated EDA — does, in a relatively simplistic way.  In BOA, Bayes net or decision tree models are used to create probabilistic models of each gene in the genome. For instance, an ordering of the genes may be assumed, and then a decision tree may be used to predict the value of an element based on the values of the elements occurring earlier in the ordering. OCP-EDA moves away from BOA's very simple probabilistic inference framework and introduces subtler but more expensive probabilistic inference methods, optionally but not exclusively going to the extreme of using full OCP integrative intelligence for population modeling.

"MindOntology:Goal","http://wiki.opencog.org/w/MindOntology:Goal","MindOntology:Goal","To put it semi-mathematically: A Goal is a mathematical function that a system seeks to maximize.  Or, just about equivalently: A Goal is a state of affairs that a system seeks to cause to occur.     Trickiness of Defining ""Goal""  This is actually a fairly difficult concept to fully mathematize, because it is difficult to define ""seek"" if one has not first defined ""goal"". One can fairly easily define the goals a system has achieved in hindsight -- what functions the system has maximized over its past history.  However, it is harder to say what functions the system is seeking to maximize.  For example, a 15 year old may have a goal of becoming immortal, and then get hit by a car and die -- but that doesn't mean he didn't have the goal, even though he came nowhere near to maximizing the function defining the goal (lifespan).      Explicit and Implicit Goals  One way to define the concept of Goal more precisely is to introduce explicit versus implicit goals. One may define an Explicit Goal as a goal that is explicitly represented inside a mind, as a function that the mind knows it is trying to maximize. One may also define an Implicit Goal of a system as something that the system looks, to a very smart observer, like it is working toward. In the case of the 15 year old immortalist, immortality may be both an explicit and implicit goal. In the case of a confused person, implicit and explicit goals may be out of synch.  The explicit goal -- what the person thinks they are seeking -- may be different than what an intelligent observer would see they are actually seeking.  This is rather common in human affairs. In general, alignment of explicit and implicit goals is one aspect of Self-Actualization; and also a characteristic one would like to see any mind capable of Strong Self-Modification possessing, as a prerequisite to Friendly AI.

Please put in a comparable amount of thought -- and, if you like, discuss on the AGI email list (see below) -- before adding a new top-level sub-ontology.  Thanks!    Venue for Discussion  The appropriate venue for discussing issues related to the Mind Ontology is the AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) email list, which you can sign up for via http://www.agiri.org/email/    Motivations  This Mind Ontology was initially created by Ben Goertzel in November 2006, with the goal of building a common language for discussing Artificial General Intelligence and Cognitive Science.   A major inspiration was the Gene Ontology (see http://www.geneontology.org), which is a systematic categorization of genes according to their functions.   A motivating observation was that discussions between individuals with different perspectives on AGI and cognition are often difficult as much because of lack of common terminology as because of differing points of view.     Major Sources  Most of the initial Mind Ontology was drawn from three sources:   Ben Goertzel's ideas about cognition and AGI, largely as described in his book The Hidden Pattern  A wholesale importation of Stan Franklin's ontology of cognition, given at http://ccrg.cs.memphis.edu/tutorial/glossary.html  Importation of bits and pieces of the Principia Cybernetica ontology, given at http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/  (Other major sources may be listed here as becomes relevant as the Mind Ontology grows.  Minor sources from which bits and pieces of information are derived need not be listed here, but may be listed on the relevant pages.)    For Those Who Wish to Augment or Modify the Mind Ontology  The comments in this section are mostly relevant to people who want to contribute to the Mind Ontology via adding new entries or substantially improving existing ones.  They describe the current ""design ideas"" underlying the Mind Ontology, which are of course open to discussion and change.     Multi-Perspectivism  Many of the topics treated in the Mind Ontology are matters of hypothesis or theory rather than fact, at this stage. The Mind Ontology is not intended to represent any highly specific theory of mind, intelligence or AGI.  Of course, some theoretical assumptions are built into its very construction (for instance, if you believe the essence of intelligence is a mystical vital force, then doubtless you will find all this talk about specific components of intelligence to be ""much ado about nothing"").  But the intention is that the theory-specificity of the Mind Ontology should be minimized. Thus, if you find yourself disagreeing with something in the Mind Ontology, and it is a matter of hypothesis/theory rather than fact or formal definition, you are encouraged to add a concise and well-formulated summary of your own perspective to the relevent entries, or to construct new entries indicating your own perspective.  References to publications or websites bolstering or reflecting your perspective will be much appreciated as well. However, you should not remove others' content simply because you disagree with their theories or hypotheses.  Rather, you should add your own views and explicitly present them as alternatives.  This may be tricky to do in some cases where different conceptual approaches are wildly different and may even imply wholly different ontological structures.  But even so, this is the right approach, in terms of building a collective understanding of the nature of artificial and biological mind and intelligence, which is the point of this Mind Ontology.    Semantic Conventions  Before modifying or augmenting the Mind Ontology, please read a bunch of entries carefully (both long and short ones; both abstract and concrete ones; etc.), to get a sense for the overall style and formal conventions.  Each entry in the Mind Ontology should contain    some content describing some term of relevance to AGI or cognitive science, including text and/or other media and/or embedded links to other sources  some links to other Mind Ontology entries, in a section titled Mind Ontology Links (which should always begin with a link to this page, the root of the Mind Ontology)  potentially, a separate section titled Links, containing hyperlinks leading outside the Mind Ontology  The links in the Mind Ontology Links section should use the following semantic link types (The best way to get a sense for the use of these is to look at existing pages, of course). Supercategory   e.g. Event is a supercategory of Action Subcategory   e.g Action is a subcategory of Event Associated   e.g. Novamente Cognition Engine is associated with NARS Every page, except this one and the top-level sub-ontologies directly listed on this page, should have at least one Supercategory link.  This guarantees that all pages can be reached from this page by following Supercategory links.  Some pages may have no other links but the one required Supercategory link, which is just fine. As conventions to maximize navigability of Mind Ontology Links, the following are suggested:   list links in the following order: Supercategories, then Subcategories, then Associations  within each category, list links alphabetically    Furthermore, there is a suggested ""meta semantic link"" called Orthogonal, to be used to indicate the case in which different sets of subcategories denote orthogonal subcategorizations.  For an example of the usage of this, see the Mind Ontology Links section of the Mind entry.

Please put in a comparable amount of thought -- and, if you like, discuss on the AGI email list (see below) -- before adding a new top-level sub-ontology.  Thanks! </p>   <h2> <span class=""mw-headline"" id=""Venue_for_Discussion""> Venue for Discussion </span></h2>   <p>The appropriate venue for discussing issues related to the Mind Ontology is the AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) email list, which you can sign up for via <a class=""external free"" href=""http://www.agiri.org/email/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.agiri.org/email/</a> </p>   <h2> <span class=""mw-headline"" id=""Motivations""> Motivations </span></h2>   <p>This Mind Ontology was initially created by Ben Goertzel in November 2006, with the goal of building a common language for discussing <a href=""/w/Artificial_General_Intelligence"" title=""Artificial General Intelligence"">Artificial General Intelligence</a> and <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/w/Cognitive_Science"" title=""Cognitive Science"">Cognitive Science</a>.  <br/> </p> <p>A major inspiration was the Gene Ontology (see <a class=""external free"" href=""http://www.geneontology.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.geneontology.org</a>), which is a systematic categorization of genes according to their functions.  <br/> </p> <p>A motivating observation was that discussions between individuals with different perspectives on AGI and cognition are often difficult as much because of lack of common terminology as because of differing points of view. <br/> </p>   <h2> <span class=""mw-headline"" id=""Major_Sources""> Major Sources </span></h2>   <p>Most of the initial Mind Ontology was drawn from three sources:<br/> </p>   <ul><li> Ben Goertzel's ideas about cognition and AGI, largely as described in his book <i>The Hidden Pattern</i> </li><li> A wholesale importation of Stan Franklin's ontology of cognition, given at <a class=""external free"" href=""http://ccrg.cs.memphis.edu/tutorial/glossary.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ccrg.cs.memphis.edu/tutorial/glossary.html</a> </li><li> Importation of bits and pieces of the Principia Cybernetica ontology, given at <a class=""external free"" href=""http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/</a> </li></ul>   <p>(Other major sources may be listed here as becomes relevant as the Mind Ontology grows.  Minor sources from which bits and pieces of information are derived need not be listed here, but may be listed on the relevant pages.) </p>   <h2> <span class=""mw-headline"" id=""For_Those_Who_Wish_to_Augment_or_Modify_the_Mind_Ontology""> For Those Who Wish to Augment or Modify the Mind Ontology </span></h2>   <p>The comments in this section are mostly relevant to people who want to contribute to the Mind Ontology via adding new entries or substantially improving existing ones.  They describe the current ""design ideas"" underlying the Mind Ontology, which are of course open to discussion and change. <br/> </p>   <h3> <span class=""mw-headline"" id=""Multi-Perspectivism""> Multi-Perspectivism </span></h3>   <p>Many of the topics treated in the Mind Ontology are matters of hypothesis or theory rather than fact, at this stage. </p> <p>The Mind Ontology is not intended to represent any highly specific theory of mind, intelligence or AGI.  Of course, some theoretical assumptions are built into its very construction (for instance, if you believe the essence of intelligence is a mystical vital force, then doubtless you will find all this talk about specific components of intelligence to be ""much ado about nothing"").  But the intention is that the theory-specificity of the Mind Ontology should be minimized.<br/> </p> <p>Thus, if you find yourself disagreeing with something in the Mind Ontology, and it is a matter of hypothesis/theory rather than fact or formal definition, you are encouraged to add a concise and well-formulated summary of your own perspective to the relevent entries, or to construct new entries indicating your own perspective.  References to publications or websites bolstering or reflecting your perspective will be much appreciated as well.<br/> </p> <p>However, you should not remove others' content simply because you disagree with their theories or hypotheses.  Rather, you should add your own views and explicitly present them as alternatives.  This may be tricky to do in some cases where different conceptual approaches are wildly different and may even imply wholly different ontological structures.  But even so, this is the right approach, in terms of building a collective understanding of the nature of artificial and biological mind and intelligence, which is the point of this Mind Ontology.<br/> </p>   <h3> <span class=""mw-headline"" id=""Semantic_Conventions""> Semantic Conventions </span></h3>   <p>Before modifying or augmenting the Mind Ontology, please read a bunch of entries carefully (both long and short ones; both abstract and concrete ones; etc.), to get a sense for the overall style and formal conventions. <br/> Each entry in the Mind Ontology should contain <br/> </p>   <ul><li> some content describing some term of relevance to AGI or cognitive science, including text and/or other media and/or embedded links to other sources </li><li> some links to other Mind Ontology entries, in a section titled Mind Ontology Links (which should always begin with a link to this page, the root of the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/w/Mind_Ontology"" title=""Mind Ontology"">Mind Ontology</a>) </li><li> potentially, a separate section titled Links, containing hyperlinks leading outside the Mind Ontology </li></ul>   <p>The links in the Mind Ontology Links section should use the following semantic link types (The best way to get a sense for the use of these is to look at existing pages, of course).<br/> </p> <p><b>Supercategory</b> <br/>  e.g. <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/w/Event"" title=""Event"">Event</a> is a supercategory of <a class=""new"" href=""/wikihome/index.php?title=Action&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1"" title=""Action (page does not exist)"">Action</a><br/> <b>Subcategory</b> <br/>  e.g <a class=""new"" href=""/wikihome/index.php?title=Action&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1"" title=""Action (page does not exist)"">Action</a> is a subcategory of <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/w/Event"" title=""Event"">Event</a><br/> <b>Associated</b> <br/>  e.g. <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/w/Novamente_Cognition_Engine"" title=""Novamente Cognition Engine"">Novamente Cognition Engine</a> is associated with <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/w/NARS"" title=""NARS"">NARS</a><br/> </p> <p>Every page, except this one and the top-level sub-ontologies directly listed on this page, should have at least one <b>Supercategory</b> link.  This guarantees that all pages can be reached from this page by following <b>Supercategory</b> links.  Some pages may have no other links but the one required <b>Supercategory</b> link, which is just fine.<br/> </p> <p>As conventions to maximize navigability of Mind Ontology Links, the following are suggested: </p>   <ul><li> list links in the following order: Supercategories, then Subcategories, then Associations </li><li> within each category, list links alphabetically </li></ul>   <p><br/>  Furthermore, there is a suggested ""meta semantic link"" called <b>Orthogonal</b>, to be used to indicate the case in which different sets of subcategories denote orthogonal subcategorizations.

This edited volume -- the first ever to focus exclusively on Artificial General Intelligence -- is edited by AGIRI founders Dr. Ben Goertzel and Cassio Pennachin and contains chapters authored by the leaders of various AGI research programs from universities, corporations and research institutes around the world. A partial author list includes: Ben Goertzel (AGIRI), Cassio Pennachin (AGIRI), Marcus Hutter (IDSIA), Juergen Schmidhuber (ISDIA), Pei Wang (Temple University), Peter Voss (A2I2), Vladimir Redko (Keldysh Institute), Eliezer Yudkowsky (SIAI), and Lukasz Kaiser (Aachen University of Technology).  Engineering General Intelligence. Ben Goertzel. Due for publication in 2007.   A treatment of the SMEPH approach to analyzing and engineering intelligence; with a substantial focus on the mathematics and concepts and principles underlying the Novamente AI Engine, which is treated as a particular instantation of the SMEPH idea.

MOSES has been successfully applied to solve hard problems in domains such as computational biology, sentiment evaluation, and agent control. Results tend to be more accurate, and require less objective function evaluations, in comparison to other program evolution systems. Best of all, the result of running MOSES is not a large nested structure or numerical vector, but a compact and comprehensible program written in a simple Lisp-like mini-language.

However, the design of the system (at a moderate level of detail) is complete, and the Novamente LLC software team possesses a deep understanding of the design and the capability to complete its implementation and training. The NCE is now being used to control a simulated humanoid agent in 3D simulation world called AGISim, similar to a video game world, and in this context is being taught simple behaviors such as playing fetch and tag, finding objects, and recognizing objects by name. These teaching exercises serve to give the system basic world-knowledge which can then be deployed for other applications.    Practical Applications  As it matures, the NCE will (if development goes as intended) be useful for a host of practical applications. The first applications envisioned are in the area of natural language processing. After a modest amount of additional development, it will be possible to use the NCE to power natural language processing applications with a level of sophistication not seen in the marketplace today. For example, it should be possible to achieve an “Ask Jeeves” type functionality that actually works and is able to intelligently answer a variety of natural language questions. Some groundwork for this sort of language processing application has been laid via the creation of the NovaLingua natural language software during the last few years – a toolkit that carries out language functionalities such as parsing, semantic mapping and word sense disambiguation using a combination of cutting-edge algorithms. Integration of NovaLingua into the NCE will allow this linguistic knowledge to synergize with the knowledge obtained via the NCE’s embodiment in the AGISim world, to enable an unprecedented level of linguistic and pragmatic understanding.    Medium Term Goals  A little further down the road, the long-term objective of NCE development is to create a powerful “artificial scientist” that can ingest a vast variety of quantitative, relational and textual data from the Internet and then interact with human scientists to produce innovative scientific creations and discoveries. Preliminary work in this direction has already been carried out via utilization of some of the NCE’s functions in a bioscience context, to help with bioinformatic data analysis and the extraction of semantic relationships from biomedical research abstracts.

"MindOntology:Patternism","http://wiki.opencog.org/w/MindOntology:Patternism","MindOntology:Patternism","Previous: OpenCogPrime:Closely Related Work The Patternist Philosophy of Mind The patternist philosophy of mind is a general approach to thinking about intelligent systems which I (Ben Goertzel) have developed during the last two decades (in a series of publications beginning in 1991, most recently The Hidden Pattern). It is based on the very simple premise that mind is made of pattern. Now, pattern as the basis of mind is not in itself is a very novel idea — this concept is present, for instance, in the 19th-century philosophy of Charles Peirce (1935), in the writings of contemporary philosopher Daniel Dennett (1991), in Benjamin Whorf's (1964) linguistic philosophy and Gregory Bateson's (1979) systems theory of mind and nature. Bateson spoke of the ""Metapattern"": that it is pattern which connects. In a series of prior writings (Goertzel, 1993, 1993a, 1994, 1997, 2001) and most recently in the philosophical treatise The Hidden Pattern (2006), I have sought to pursue this theme more thoroughly than has been done before, and to articulate in detail how various aspects of human mind and mind in general can be well-understood by explicitly adopting a patternist perspective. This work includes attempts to formally ground the notion of pattern in mathematics such as algorithmic information theory (Chaitin, 1986; Solomonoff, 1964, 1978) and probability theory, beginning from the conceptual notion that a pattern is a representation as something simpler and then utilizing appropriate mathematical concepts of representation and simplicity. In prior writings I have used the term psynet model of mind to refer to the application of patternist philosophy to cognitive theory, but I have now deprecated that term as it seemed to introduce more confusion than clarification. In the patternist perspective, the mind of an intelligent system is conceived as the set of patterns in that system, and the set of patterns emergent between that system and other systems with which it interacts. The latter clause means that the patternist perspective is inclusive of notions of distributed intelligence (Hutchins, 1996). Intelligence is conceived, similarly to in Marcus Hutter's (2005) recent work, as the ability to achieve complex goals in complex environments; where complexity itself may be defined as the possession of a rich variety of patterns. A mind is thus a collection of patterns that is associated with a persistent dynamical process that achieves highly-patterned goals in highly-patterned environments. An additional hypothesis made within the patternist philosophy of mind is that reflection is critical to intelligence. This lets us conceive of an intelligent system as a dynamical system that recognizes patterns in its environment and itself, as part of its quest to achieve complex goals. While this approach is quite general, it is not vacuous; it gives a particular structure to the tasks of analyzing and synthesizing intelligent systems. About any would-be intelligent system, we are led to ask questions such as:   How are patterns represented in the system? That is, how does the underlying infrastructure of the system give rise to the displaying of a particular pattern in the system's behavior?   What kinds of patterns are most compactly represented within the system?  What kinds of patterns are most simply learned?  What learning processes are utilized for recognizing patterns?  What mechanisms are used to give the system the ability to introspect (so that it can recognize patterns in itself?  Now, these same sorts of questions could be asked if one substituted the word pattern with other words like knowledge or information. However, I have found that asking these questions in the context of pattern leads to more productive answers, because the concept of pattern ties in very nicely with the details of various existing formalisms and algorithms for knowledge representation and learning. Pursuing the patternist philosophy in detail leads to a variety of particular hypotheses and conclusions. Following from the view of intelligence in terms of achieving complex goals in complex environments, comes a view in which the dynamics of a cognitive system are understood to be governed by two main forces: self-organization and goal-oriented behavior. And more specifically, based on these concepts several primary dynamical principles may be posited, including:   Association. Patterns, when given attention, spread some of this attention to other patterns that they have previously been associated with in some way. Furthermore, there is Peirce's law of mind (Peirce, 1935), which could be paraphrased in modern terms as stating that the mind is an associative memory network, whose dynamics dictate that every idea in the memory is an active agent, continually acting on those ideas with which the memory associates it.  Differential attention allocation. Patterns that have been valuable for goal-achievement are given more attention, and are encouraged to participate in giving rise to new patterns.  Pattern creation. Patterns that have been valuable for goal-achievement are mutated and combined with each other to yield new patterns.  Credit Assignment. Habitual patterns in the system that are found valuable for goal-achievement are explicitly reinforced and made more habitual.  Next, for a variety of reasons it becomes appealing to hypothesize that the network of patterns in an intelligent system must give rise to the following large-scale emergent structures   Hierarchical network. Patterns are habitually in relations of control over other patterns that represent more specialized aspects of themselves.  Heterarchical network. The system retains a memory of which patterns have previously been associated with each other in any way.  Dual network. Hierarchical and heterarchical structures are combined, with the dynamics of the two structures working together harmoniously.  Self structure. A portion of the network of patterns forms into an approximate image of the overall network of patterns.

For example, a symbolic form may be ""On(apple,table)"" signifying the apple is on the table. Symbol grounding -- may refer to several concepts; one of which is: ""Sensory"" symbol grounding -- Any means by which a symbolic representation becomes non-arbitrary because of its binding to sensory experience.  For example the word ""apple"" can be an arbitrary signifier.  The mapping of the word ""apple"" to a node that detects apples from the vision sensors enables the binding of the word to sensory experience. Logic -- usually refers to FOL (first order predicate logic).  FOL includes predicates, variables, functions, and the universal and existential quantifiers.  For some knowledge representation purposes using a subset of FOL may be desirable.  One subset is Horn logic. Emergence -- Self-organization -- Working Memory -- A conduit for information exchange among modules.  WM is passive in the sense that it does not modify its contents. Planner module -- The module responsible for solving complex problems.  It communicates with other modules by issuing commands to or requesting information from them.  It has supreme executive power in the sense that its commands override other modules such as the inference engine. Inference Engine -- Performs logical inference (including induction, abduction and deduction) from premises in Working Memory. Pattern Recognizer -- aka Concept Recognizer -- Recognizes patterns in Working Memory.  For example, if 2 eyes, 1 nose, 1 mouth on a head is presented as facts in WM, then the ""face"" pattern is recognized and the result is added to WM as a new fact. Knowledge maintenance module -- Maintains the integrity of the knowledgebase, ie Semantic and Generic Memories.  For example, deciding which one of several conflicting facts/rules should be retracted or modified. Fact -- A logical statement, eg ""Kicks(john,mary,t1)"" meaning that John kicks Mary at time t1. Rule -- A general logical statement, ie one with variables.  For example ""forall x: Man(x)->Mortal(x)"" means that all men are mortal. Inductive learning module -- Performs ""data-mining"" functions.  Given some facts in WM, discover general rules that cover them.  For example, from many instances of women having long hair generalize that women have long hair with probability p. Natural Language Processor -- Performs the mapping of natural language to and from the internal knowledge representation.  This mapping may also be defined by modifiable rules, thus allowing language learning. Semantic memory -- Stores the meanings of concepts, ie, the definition of concepts / patterns.  For example, the definition of  ""face"" in terms of eyes, nose, mouth, and their relative positions, etc. Episodic memory -- Events that happened in sensory experience, with a specific timestamp. Generic memory -- Any knowledge that is not episodic, excluding semantic memory.  For example, ""entropy is the measure of disorder"", or ""Boltzmann commited suicide in 1906"".  (In cognitive psychology, this term includes semantic memory, we exclude it.) Procedural memory -- In cognitive psychology, procedural memory is not accessible to conscious thinking, for example, how to walk or how to ride a bicycle.  We use this term to mean a repository of knowledge for the Planner module.  That means any knowledge gained by the Planner about how to solve problems. Procedural learning -- Any form of learning occuring inside the Planner module.  The Planner gains knowledge of how to solve complex problems and stores such knowledge in Procedural Memory.

"MindOntology:Problem","http://wiki.opencog.org/w/MindOntology:Problem","MindOntology:Problem"," Definition of ""Problem"" A problem is a situation which is experienced by an agent as different from the situation which the agent ideally would like to be in. A problem is solved by a sequence of actions that reduce the difference between the initial situation and the goal A problem can be analysed into more specific components. First of all it consists of the two situations, the present one which we will call the initial state, and the desired one, which we can call the goal state. The agent's task is to get from the initial state to the goal state by means of series of actions that change the state. The problem is solved if such a series of actions has been found, and the goal has been reached. In general, problem-solving is a component of goal-directed action or control. (from http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/PROBSOLV.html) Note that, defined as such, a problem may be one that demands General Intelligence for its solution (e.g. survival in a complex environment), or it may be one that only demands Specialized Intelligence for its solution (e.g. playing chess).  In the latter case problems are often addressed by the application of individual Learning Algorithms.    Problem Types  The Mind Ontology Links section of this page contains a list of some common ""machine learning problem"" types.
