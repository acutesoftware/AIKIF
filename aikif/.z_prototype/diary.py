# diary.py

"""
Example of using AIKIF to record diary events.

1. setup data structures

2. define mappings such as what to record from command line
   apps and optionally what columns to import from external
   sources such as outlook calendars
   
3. implement simple script to do manual adds (this program)

4. optionally implement processes to auto load info from
   external sources.
