Hi Duncan, 

We recently blocked a sign-in attempt to your Google Account [acutesoftware@gmail.com]. 

Sign in attempt details
Date & Time: Tuesday, January 13, 2015 1:59:22 PM UTC 
Location: Adelaide SA, Australia 

If this wasn't you
Please review your Account Activity page at https://security.google.com/settings/security/activity 
to see if anything looks suspicious. Whoever tried to sign in to your account knows your password; 
we recommend that you change it right away. 

If this was you
You can switch to an app made by Google such as Gmail to access your account (recommended) 
or change your settings at https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps so that 
your account is no longer protected by modern security standards. 

To learn more, see https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255. 

Sincerely,
The Google Accounts team
--------------------------------------------

Switched to unsecure access, and got the email confirmation, but still not working:

You recently changed your security settings so that your Google Account 
[acutesoftware@gmail.com] is no longer protected by modern security standards.
