AIKIF - Artificial Intelligence Knowledge Information Framework

This is an information classification framework that maps structured or freeform data to 
a standard knowledge store.

Raw data is collected via Agents and the Mapper uses your business rules to convert and 
store the information in a machine usable format (by linking to ontologies).

Your AI software can link to AIKIF by setting up logging watch-points to define success / 
failure along with the range of input parameters. Goals and plans are defined by breaking 
them down to smaller tasks until the task can be run by a tool in the Toolbox.

A tool is any python wrapped function or application and is easily extensible.
