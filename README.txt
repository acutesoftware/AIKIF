AIKIF - Artificial Intelligence Knowledge Information Framework


This is an example framework to capture the flow of information initially for personal data management, but ultimately useful for AI applications.

The intent is to allow any type of raw data to be machine understandable using data collectors, ontologies, business mapping rules and embedded tags in programs.
